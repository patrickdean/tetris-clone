tetris-clone
============

This an XNA version of Tetris I made when I was in college. The gameplay source code was written by me using the [Tetris Guidline](http://tetris.wikia.com/wiki/Tetris_Guideline) as guidance. The menu source code was adapted (slightly) from Microsoft's [Game State Management](http://create.msdn.com/en-US/education/catalog/sample/game_state_management) sample on [AppHub](http://create.msdn.com).


NOTE: The audio files required by the project are not included as sounds and music that I used did not belong to me. I'll try and find some open sound effect & music to add to the project so it's completely functional out of the box at some point.
